# Dojo

## The Code

Some example projects in multiple languages setup to be ready to jump in and start writing some tests.

To get started run one of the following:

```
$ make elm
$ make javascript
$ make java
$ make php
```

There's also some resources setup such as file watchers for Intellij. To install the file watchers run:

```
$ make intellij-file-watchers 
```

## The Katas

### Prime Factors

Write a function which takes a number and return a list of its prime factors.

e.g.

```
factorise(6); // returns [ 2, 3 ]
```
